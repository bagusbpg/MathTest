This Math quiz is 10-problems format in a limited time of 20 minutes.

The things I want to improve in the future are:
1. Using LaTeX rendering module to handle mathematical equations. I have tried io.github.kexanie.library:MathView:0.0.6 and com.github.jstarczewski:MathView:0.4.0, but to no success.
2. Add explanation page on how to get the correct answer for each problems. My final goal is to make this app also functions as self-learning tutorial.
